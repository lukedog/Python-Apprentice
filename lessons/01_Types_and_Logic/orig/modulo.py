# TODO:
#  Modulo really just means "remainder after division".
#  However, it's probably easier to understand from some examples
#  -
#  A common use for modulo is to test if a number is odd or even.
#  To do this test, you divide the number by 2.
#  If the remainder is zero, the number is even, but if the remainder is one, the number is odd.
#  In code this would look like this:
 number = random.randint(0,100)
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(str(number) + " is even")
    else:
        print(str(number) + " is odd")

# TODO: Another use for modulo could be to track every 20 times a loop is executed, as follows:
    for i in range(101):
        # do some code
        if i % 20 == 0:
            print("20 more repeats completed")
